![Qmusic banner](/docs/assets/qmusic-banner.jpg)

## About

This is a bot for the [Qmusic](https://qmusic.nl) radio station. It has systems in place to retrieve the current playing song, upcoming songs, and more.
It can also be used to listen to all the Qmusic radio stations in your Discord Voice Channels.
Qmusic occasionally hosts contests where you can win prizes by being sending a text message or clicking a button on their app.
This bot can automatically send these messages and perform these actions for you, so you don't have to.

### Currently Supported Games

- üèùÔ∏è **Catch The Summer Hit**: Catch a song on your list when it is playing on the radio by clicking a button in the app. You gain points for every song you
  catch
  and gain a streak. The more points you have, the higher you are on the leaderboard. The top 50 players at the end of the week win a prize, and the top 3-5
  wins a grant prize.<br>The bot can catch these songs automatically for you.
- üéôÔ∏è **Catch The Artist**: Send an app message when a specific artist is playing on the radio to win prizes (usually concert tickets). You can be notified when
  the
  artist is coming up next, currently playing, and the bot can also send the app message for you.
- üîä **Het Geluid**: Guess the sound that is playing on the radio to win the prize money. You can sign up to guess for the current day using the bot, as well as
  retrieve all the information about the worth of the sound, the previous guesses, and maybe a hint.

## Installation

This bot is written in JavaScript and runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
You can install Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

After installing Node.js, you can install the bot by running the following command in the root directory of the bot:

```shell
yarn
```

or using npm:

```shell
npm install
```

## Configuration

Before you can run the bot, you need to configure it.

1. Take the provided `env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
2. Fill in the required values such as your Discord Bot token and the ID of the channel that you are dedicating to the bot. You can find your bot token on
   the [Discord Applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) dashboard.
3. Create a `tokens.json` file in the root directory and enter your account details in the format mentioned below. Make sure to replace the values with your own
   account details. Adding multiple accounts to the bot by adding more objects to the JSON file is possible. Make sure to identify each account by its email
   address. As of a newer version of the bot, it is no longer required to add your credentials manually. You can now use the `/qmusic addaccount` command to add
   accounts to the bot.
   You can also remove these accounts again with the `/qmusic removeaccount` command.
   The Discord ID is optional but needed if you want to receive @pings in the Discord server when the bot does something related to you.

## Authentication Process

The bot uses the [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) protocol to authenticate with the Qmusic API.
A JWT token is used to authenticate with the API. This token is generated by the bot using the provided credentials.

In order for the bot to start the login process, the [DPG Media Cookie Policy](https://privacy.dpgmedia.be/nl/document/cookie-policy-b2b) must be accepted.  
Below is a complete overview of the authentication process.

## Future Development

QMusic could change their API at any time, which could break some of the bot's functionality.

Did they add a new game or change the API? You can read how to [observe network traffic](docs/observe-network-traffic.md) to find out how the QMusic app is
using the network and how to adapt the bot to these changes.

*This bot is not affiliated with QMusic or DPG Media in any way. It is a personal project to automate some of the tasks that are required to play the games on
the QMusic app.*
